Answers to questions:

If we want to add a multiplication operation, we will have to do the following:
1. Add a TextView for the multiplication button in activity_main.xml
2. set on click listener for the multiplication button
3. In file 'SimpleCalculator' add the function void insertMult();
4. In file 'SimpleCalculatorImpl' implement the function void insertMult();

Tests to run on the calculator:
in SimpleCalculatorImplTest we check that when the user presses the multiplication button, the output is multiplication sign.

in AppFlowTest we test a flow of nultiplication operation for example 3*2=.

in MainActivityTest add a test that checks when the multiplication button is pressed, the listener function is called and then the output is the pressed button.
